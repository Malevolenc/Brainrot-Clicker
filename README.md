# Brainrot-Clicker

23/6/2025:
- This is my third time making this game.
- The first attempt is still in my repositories
- I deleted the second version because too many glitches.

- You click the skibidi button to gain skibidi bucks.
- You use those skibidi bucks to purchase upgrades.
- Button upgrades make your button much better by giving you more skibidi bucks per click
- Idle upgrades give you passive money generation per second.

- Planning to add many more features from my older version such as rebirthing / kanye west final boss / buying different buttons / and a save mechanic.

- That is all for now, all other notes will be written in the info section in the website by clicking the exclamation button on the top right of the screen.

Malevolence :)
